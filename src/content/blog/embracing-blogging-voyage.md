description: Join me on a new journey! After 7 years in the programming trenches, I dicided to start a blog.
---

As a software developer, I have spent the past 7 years focusing on my career, including project thinking, freelancing, and finding the best company to work for based on my goals.

Throughout this journey, I have developed many skills directly related to my daily work. However, there has always been one thing I wanted to do but lacked the confidence for: creating content. I have never written a blog post, shared my thoughts, or contributed to the developer community in a meaningful way. But now, after 7 years as a professional developer and over 10 years of studying code, I have finally decided to start blogging. My motivation for doing so is not because I believe I have valuable lessons to share, but because I want to make this blog a place where I can store my ideas, like a journal of my adventures as a programmer.

I don't intend for this blog to become a tech trend blog. Instead, it is my way of facing my fear of exposure and hoping that, in the process, it becomes a valuable resource for me to look back on in the coming years and think, "Wow, I've really evolved."

## Strengthening Communication and Thought Process

Blogging provides a platform for me to improve my communication skills, thought process, and English language proficiency, as English is not my native language.

As developers, we often immerse ourselves in code, tackling complex problems and delving into technical details. However, it is equally important to be able to express our thoughts, ideas, and solutions effectively.

Writing blog posts compels me to organize my ideas, structure my thoughts, and present them coherently. This exercise not only enhances my ability to communicate clearly but also helps refine my thought process. Explaining technical concepts and solutions in a simplified manner requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, which in turn strengthens my own knowledge and expertise.

I firmly believe that when we teach someone, we also learn twice as much.

## Building a Personal Brand and Networking

Finally, starting a blog allows me to build a personal brand and expand my professional network. In today's competitive job market, having a strong personal brand can set one apart from other candidates. By consistently creating valuable content, I can showcase my expertise, problem-solving skills, and passion for software development.

Additionally, blogging provides an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals in the developer community. By engaging with readers, receiving feedback, and participating in discussions, I can expand my network and establish valuable professional relationships.

## Conclusion

TL;DR: For those of you who don't want to put up with my rambling â€“ I don't blame you!

After 7 years of focusing solely on coding, I have made the decision to start blogging. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I hope to contribute to the developer community, strengthen my communication skills, and build a personal brand.

Blogging is not only a means of giving back but also a way to continue learning and growing as a software developer.

I am excited to embark on this new journey and see where it takes me in my career and personal growth. By documenting my thoughts and experiences, I will not only be able to reflect on my own growth but also inspire and educate others who may be on a similar path.

So, join me on this blogging voyage as we embark on a new chapter of growth, learning, and collaboration.
